HPC prog_geneticParallel
=================================
This is CSE6220 course project. The goal is to find all genetic sequence that is within certain hamming distance.

To see course project file, open "6220prog_geneticParallel.pdf"

To see my report, open "report_geneticParallel". I analysis sequential and parallel speedup performance in it.

How to run..



Simply run `make` in the projects directory to build the two executables: `findmotifs` and
`generate_input`. Run each without commandline parameters for seeing usage
descriptions.
